Abstraction:- 
==========

Abstraction is the process in which we hide the implementation of the method and show the functionality.
in another word, we show only important parts to the user and hide internal things from the user.


Abstract class:- 
=============

An abstract class is one that uses abstract keywords. The abstract class has abstract and non-abstract methods.

In abstract class, we need to use abstract keywords and with the help of this class we can achieve abstraction.

Exp:- 

Abstract   Hello {


public abstract hey();


}


Interface:-
===========

The interface is the blueprint of a class. The interface has static and abstract methods java 8 onwards have default methods as well.

There are 3 uses of the Interface:-
===========================

1. We can achieve 100% abstraction.
2. We can achieve loose coupling.
3. Multiple inheritance functionality suport by inteface.



 Interface Hello {

public int sum(a,b);

}
